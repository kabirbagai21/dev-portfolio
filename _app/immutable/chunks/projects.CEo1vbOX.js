To focus learning on the most relevant regions, we designed an intelligent patch selection strategy guided by vascular anatomy, significantly improving model efficiency and accuracy. We also optimized the pipeline's memory usage—reducing the training footprint by over 40%—through custom TensorFlow operations and efficient data loading. We were able to achieve a 0.76 Dice score and 83% sensitivity on the test set, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in identifying aneurysms in complex 3D MRA volumes.",shortDescription:"This a deep learning system for detecting and segmenting cerebral aneurysms in Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography",links:[{to:"https://github.com/",label:"GitHub"},{to:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A583KvoxQYENKU4906acYr8Om4b7Dzmf/view",label:"Paper"}],logo:e.Unknown,name:"Cerebral Aneurysm Detection in TOF-MRA",skills:t("py","tensorflow"),type:"Deep Learning Model"},{slug:"traffic-detection",color:"#ff3e00",description:"This project uses a dataset of images of street traffic captured at the Amsterdam Ave. and 120th Street intersection. The goal was to build a model that can effectively identify rare classes and situations that have the potential to disrupt traffic flow or cause harm to pedestrians (barricades, emergency vehicles, traffic cones etc). This task is more challenging than typical image classification tasks due to the complexity of the images, limited dataset size (100 training images), and severe class imbalance. We initially tried to train CNNs and transformer models but due to the aforementioned issues, we achieved poor performance with these. We then decided to try a zero-shot vison language model. By leveraging the pre-trained, Recognize Anything Model (RAM) and adapting it for our needs, we achieved a classification performance of 0.716 on the test set, the highest score on the Kaggle in-class competition.",shortDescription:"This project uses a dataset of images of street traffic captured at the Amsterdam Ave. and 120th Street intersection.
