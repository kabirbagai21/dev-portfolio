		description: 'I designed and implemented a deep learning pipeline to segment the choroid plexus in brain MRIsâ€”a task complicated by anatomical variability and low contrast. I built the system around a custom 3D UNet architecture and developed a fully automated preprocessing workflow (registration, normalization, data loading) to support large-scale neuroimaging data. To improve performance, I combined three MRI modalities (T1, T2, FLAIR) into a single multi-channel input, leveraging their distinct contrast properties. I also implemented custom data augmentation techniques to enhance generalization given the limited training set, resulting in an 8% improvement in Dice score on the test set.',
